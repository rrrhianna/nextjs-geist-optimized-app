## Technical Specifications

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Password TEXT NOT NULL,
    CreatedDate DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Default Credentials
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: Admin123!

### Dependencies
- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- System.Data.SQLite 1.0.118
- Windows Forms

### Security Features
- Password complexity validation
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Session management with secure logout
- Failed attempt tracking and lockout mechanism

## Installation & Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Visual Studio 2019 or later
   - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
   - SQLite support

2. **Build Instructions**:
   ```bash
   # Open in Visual Studio
   # Restore NuGet packages
   # Build solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
   # Run application (F5)
   ```

3. **Database Initialization**:
   - SQLite database is automatically created on first run
   - Default admin user is inserted if no users exist
   - Database file: `UserDatabase.db`

## Usage Guide

### First Time Setup
1. Launch the application
2. Use default credentials (admin/Admin123!) or register a new account
3. Navigate through modules using the main dashboard

### Creating New Users
1. Click "Register" on login screen
2. Enter desired username and complex password
3. Password must meet all complexity requirements
4. Account is immediately available for login

### Module Navigation
- **Temperature Converter**: Select units and enter temperature value
- **Currency Converter**: Choose currencies and enter amount
- **Calculator**: Standard calculator operations with number pad
- **Encryption Tool**: Enter text and choose encrypt/decrypt operation

## Architecture

### Form Structure
```
Program.cs (Entry Point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginForm.cs (Authentication)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainForm.cs (Dashboard)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TemperatureForm.cs (Temperature Conversion)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CurrencyForm.cs (Currency Conversion)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CalculatorForm.cs (Calculator Operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EncryptionForm.cs (Vigen√®re Cipher)
```

### Helper Classes
- **DatabaseHelper.cs**: SQLite operations and user management
- **App.config**: Configuration and connection strings
- **AssemblyInfo.cs**: Application metadata

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are stored in plain text (for educational purposes)
- In production, implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Consider implementing session timeouts
- Add logging for security events
- Implement account lockout policies

## Future Enhancements

- Password hashing and salting
- User role management
- Audit logging
- Additional cipher algorithms
- Real-time currency exchange rates
- Scientific calculator functions
- Database backup/restore functionality
